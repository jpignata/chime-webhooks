# chime-webhooks

## What does it do?

A collection of Lambda functions to broadcast pertinent details to an [Amazon
Chime](https://aws.amazon.com/chime) room. We're apparently moving to Slack, so
this is deprecated and kind of hacky, and I don't intend to improve it.

## Deployment

```bash
sam build
sam deploy
```
